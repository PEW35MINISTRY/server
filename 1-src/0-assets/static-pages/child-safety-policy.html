        <h1>Child Safety Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025 | Version 1</p>

        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p class="indent">PEW35 is committed to creating a safe and secure environment for all participants engaging with our Encouraging Prayer app and Elevate times of Prayer, Encouragement, and Worship. This Youth Protection Policy outlines the measures we take to protect the safety and well-being of youth users, ensuring their interactions are positive, supportive, and free from harm. References herein to <strong>“children”</strong> or <strong>“youth”</strong> mean persons under the age of 18 who participate in Elevate or the Encouraging Prayer app. References to <strong>“adults”</strong> mean Qualified Leaders as defined herein, age 18 and older.</p>

        <h2>Scope:</h2>
        <p class="indent">This policy applies to all volunteers, staff, and participants involved with the Encouraging Prayer mobile app, Elevate, and any related activities conducted by PEW35.</p>

        <h2>Policy Statements:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <h3>Screening and Selection of Volunteers and Staff:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PEW35 will ensure that only individuals who meet strict criteria and demonstrate a commitment to youth protection are selected to be volunteers and staff members (<strong>“Qualified Leaders”</strong>).</li>
                <li>For Elevate events, PEW35 will clearly communicate with local Elevate hosts the expectations for screening and selection and provide the training and tools to accomplish the process.</li>
                <li>All Qualified Leaders working directly with youth will undergo a comprehensive background check, including criminal history, sex offender registry, and reference checks.</li>
                <li>All Qualified Leaders must provide proof of identity and consent to background screening as a condition of participation.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Training and Education:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All Qualified Leaders working directly with youth will receive mandatory training on youth protection, appropriate conduct, and reporting procedures for suspected abuse or misconduct.</li>
                <li>Training will cover recognizing signs of abuse, maintaining appropriate boundaries, and understanding PEW35's policies and procedures for youth protection and reporting obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Re-screening:</h3>
            <p>PEW35 shall require Qualified Leaders to re-screen (i) no less than once every three years or (ii) upon the earlier request of PEW35. Any failure to fully and satisfactorily complete such re-screening shall result in the individual ceasing to be a Qualified Leader.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Code of Conduct:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Qualified Leaders and all volunteers must adhere to the PEW35 Code of Conduct that promotes respect, safety, and well-being for all youth participants.</li>
                <li>Inappropriate behavior, including but not limited to harassment, abuse, and exploitation, will not be tolerated and will result in immediate termination of involvement with PEW35.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Communication Guidelines:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>God-Honoring Communication:</strong> 
                <p class="indent">All communication, whether verbal, written, or digital, will reflect a God-honoring attitude. This aligns with the biblical principle of loving others well (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A29" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:29</a>), ensuring that our words build up rather than tear down. Every interaction should reflect kindness, patience, and care for the well-being of others.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring of Encouraging Prayer Mobile App Communications:</strong> 
                <p class="indent">All communication within the Encouraging Prayer mobile app, including those within youth group circles, is subject to monitoring and review by PEW35 staff in accordance with applicable privacy laws and in response to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A verified law enforcement request</li>
                    <li>A parental request for a student under age 13</li>
                    <li>A report of abuse or misuse</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Group Communication Between Staff and Participants:</strong>
                <p class="indent">To maintain transparency and avoid the appearance of impropriety, communication between PEW35 staff/team members and participants will not occur in a one-on-one setting. Group formats, including team environments and group messages, will be the standard for all ministry-related communication.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transparency in Communication with Youth or Children:</strong>
                <p class="indent">Any communication between PEW35 staff/team members and minors outside of Elevate or the Encouraging Prayer app will always be conducted in a transparent manner. This means using platforms that allow for tracking and visibility by others, such as group chats, emails with multiple recipients, or other forms of communication that are easily accessible for review.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Reporting and Response:</h3>

                <li>PEW35 has established clear procedures for reporting suspected abuse, neglect, or misconduct involving youth participants.</li>
                <li>All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly and confidentially.</li>
                <li>Mandatory reporting laws will be followed, and any suspected abuse will be reported to the appropriate authorities.</li>
                <li>A designated Youth Protection Officer (YPO) will be appointed to oversee and handle all reports of abuse or misconduct.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Parental Involvement:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents or guardians must provide consent for the participation of children under 13 years of age.</li>
                <li>Parents shall have access to their child’s information and authority over the same, consistent with applicable law and in accordance with PEW35 policy.</li>
                <li>Parents or guardians will have access to learn about the Encouraging Prayer app, its purpose, and the measures taken to protect their children.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Privacy and Data Protection:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PEW35 is committed to protecting the privacy and personal information of all participants.</li>
                <li>Personal data will be collected, stored, and used in compliance with applicable data protection laws and PEW35’s Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>Personal data will only be used internally and will never be shared or sold.</li>
                <li>Access to personal information will be restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Monitoring and Accountability:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PEW35 will implement regular monitoring and evaluation processes to ensure compliance with this policy and the effectiveness of youth protection measures.</li>
                <li>Feedback from youth participants, parents, and volunteers will be encouraged to identify areas for improvement and address any concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Consequences for Policy Violations:</h3>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Two-Adult Rule:</h3>
            <p class="indent">When conducting virtual or in-person activities, there should always be at least two adults present to supervise interactions with youth participants. This rule helps prevent situations where an adult is left alone with a youth participant.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Safe Physical Environment:</h3>
            <p class="indent">For in-person events, PEW35 will ensure a safe physical environment, including adequate lighting, appropriate supervision ratios, and secure facilities.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Incident Response Plan:</h3>
            <p class="indent">PEW35 will maintain a detailed incident response plan to handle any emergencies or incidents of abuse. This plan will include steps for immediate action, investigation procedures, and communication protocols.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

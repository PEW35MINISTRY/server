        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025 | Version 1</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>PEW35, Inc. ("<strong>Company</strong>" or "<strong>We</strong>") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Policy. This Policy describes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The types of information we may collect or that you may provide when you download, install, register with, access, or use the Encouraging Prayer Mobile Application or its internet desktop version (collectively referred to as the "<strong>App</strong>").</li>
            <li>Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Policy applies only to information we collect in this App, in email, text, and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with this App.</p>
        <p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with, or use this App. By downloading, registering with, or using this App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of this App after we revise this Policy means you accept those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>

        <h2>Children Under the Age of 13</h2>
        <p>Our App is designed for use by children under the age of 13, but only with the verified consent of a guardian. In compliance with child protection laws, we ensure that all interactions within the App are secure and free from data collection processes. Should we inadvertently receive information from a child we know to be under the age of 13 without guardian consent, we will promptly eliminate such data. If you have any concerns or believe that we might possess unauthorized information from a child under 13, please reach out to us immediately at the contact information noted below.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
        <p>We collect information from and about users of our App directly from you when you provide it to us at the time of registration. We do not collect data using automatic data collection technologies.</p>

        <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By which you may be personally identified, such as name, zip code, email address, birthdate, any other identifier by which you may be contacted online (<strong>personal information</strong>).</li>
            <li>That is about you but individually does not identify you, such as religious standing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the option to provide information for publication or display ("<strong>Posted</strong>") on publicly accessible areas of the App, such as a profile picture or group prayer ("User Contributions"). When posting User Contributions, it's important to remember that you control the visibility of your content. Your contributions will only be visible to other users within partnerships and groups that you have approved. Additionally, within these groups, you can choose specific individuals with whom you wish to share your prayers or updates.</p>
        <p>Please note, all <strong>User Contributions</strong> are shared at your own discretion. While we work to maintain a secure platform, we cannot guarantee complete security against unauthorized access, and we cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. However, by design, your posts are not accessible to anyone outside of your approved groups and partnerships.</p>
        <p>We recommend exercising caution when approving group memberships and managing your settings to further protect your privacy. If you need assistance with managing or removing your contributions, or have concerns about unauthorized access within your approved groups, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@encouragingprayer.org">support@encouragingprayer.org</a>.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>We Do Not Collect Your Data Using Automatic Data Collection Technologies</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Our App is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect or use any of the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Details:</strong> We do not collect any details about your access and use of the App, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data related to the resources that you access and use within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Stored Information and Files:</strong> The app does not access or use metadata or any other information associated with files stored on your device. This includes, but is not limited to, audio and video clips, personal contacts, and address book information. A profile picture may be selected for use by you using temporary and limited access to your stored device photos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide you with the App and its contents</li>
            <li>Notify you when App updates are available, and of changes to any services we offer or provide through it.</li>
            <li>Estimate our audience size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use location, age and gender information we collect to form prayer groups, with the intention of forming prayer groups in geographically diverse regions of the United States, and with similarly aged users.</p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information about our users from time to time.</p>
        <p>In addition, we may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an email address to use the "email a friend" feature of our App, we will transmit the contents of that email and your email address to the recipients.</li>
            <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information, and with your consent.</li>
            <li>To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not market any third-party sites or services within our app, nor do we share personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the App and visiting your account profile page.</p>
        <p>You may also send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@encouragingprayer.org">support@encouragingprayer.org</a> to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

            <div>
                <a href="/delete-account" class="action-button">
                    <button class="primary-button-blue">How to Delete Your Account</button>
                </a>
            </div>
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.</p>
        <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our App. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account.</p>
        <p>The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you and for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>
